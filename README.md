# Monty

## Desciption

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty is a language that aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages. It relies on a unique stack with specific instructions to manipulate it. By convention, the files containing Monty bytecodes have the .m extension. There is no more than one instruction per line and there can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument.
